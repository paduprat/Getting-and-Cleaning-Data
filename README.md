# Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project

This is the final assignment from the Getting and Cleaning Data course at Coursera Johns Hopkins University Data Science Track.

The goal of this assignment was to build a tidy dataset from several pieces of data supplied separately.

 The documents contained in this repo are the following:

1. **run_analysis.R**

   R Script that loads the different pieces of data, merges and binds them togheter, gives meaningful names to the variables and creates an average summary from the measurements.

2. **tidy_dataset.csv**

   The resulting dataset generated by the above R Script. For more information on its contents, check out the code_book.md file available in this repo.

3. **average_summary.csv**

   A summary dataset presenting averages of each variable from the *tidy_dataset.csv* file.

4. **code_book.md**

   Markdown document describing the contents of *tidy_dataset.csv* and *average_summary.csv* data files, as well as the data transformations applied during the execution of *run_analysis.R* .
