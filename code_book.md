# Code Book - Getting and Cleaning Data

This document describes the contents of *tidy_dataset.csv* and *average_summary.csv* data files, as well as the data transformations applied during the execution of *run_analysis.R* .

1. ***run_analysis.R* procedures and transformations**

   1. Loads the dplyr package
   2. Loads the training dataset (*subject_train.txt*, *X_train.txt* and *y_train.txt*) and the test datasets (*subject_test.txt*, *X_test.txt* and *y_test.txt*) data files using the read.table function.
   3. Loads the *features.txt* file which contains the variable names for the *X_train.txt* and *X_test.txt* datasets.
   4. Loads the *activity_labels.txt* file that contains the descriptions for the activities that the subjects performed during the study. 
   5. Applies the variable names from *features.txt* to the *X_train.txt* and *X_test.txt* datasets.
   6. Uses the names from the previous step to select and keep only the variables related to mean() and std() measurements. 
   7. Renames the variables that describe that subjects IDs and activity IDs to *subjectID* and *activityID*
   8. Binds the columns *subjectID* and *activityID* to the train and test datasets
   9. Binds the rows from the train and test dataset, creating a single complete dataset.
   10. Merges the *activity_labels* to the complete dataset.
   11. Uses the *group_by()* function from the dplyr package to calculate the means for each variable in the complete dataset, grouping the results by subjectID and activityID.

2. **tidy_dataset.csv** and **average_summary.csv**

   Both datasets contain the following variables:
